# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with 
docs here.This is the FEATURES building blocks of the claudify project

This is base for any enterprise grade backend which is supposed to work for small/big apps

## Overview

- a sophisticated Python architecture framework with multiple abstraction layers. 
- Currently in documentation phase, awaiting implementation.
- Focus on perfect documentation so that it is easy to build the code

## Code Snippets Abstractions

- Code snippets use Rich,FastApi,Typer,Console,Ruff compliant code
- Use short and crisp names than long variables and function names
- When main class definition suggest the choices based on functionality provided and let me choose

## Communication Guidelines

- Given frequent timeouts going forward, break tasks into small subtasks and act on each. Break into Task 1.1 kind of syntax. Keep history of Todos in TODO.txt and check once finished
- Always ask one question at a time and explain to me choices and pros and cons with approaches and usage to help me make decisions if architecture

## Development Workflow

- Always run demos and tests using uv so that env is set properly. You don't need to run venv kind of scripts at all

## Type Annotations

- dont use union optional, use latest operators like | follow latest python standards
