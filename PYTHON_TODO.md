- Prevent cascading failures when external APIs are down
- Auto-recovery with exponential backoff

### 2. Distributed Tracing with OpenTelemetry
- Full request tracing across services
- Integration with Jaeger/Zipkin
- Automatic instrumentation for FastAPI
- Performance bottleneck identification

### 3. A/B Testing Framework
- Feature flag based testing
- User cohort management
- Metrics collection per variant
- Statistical significance calculation

### 4. Feature Flags System
- Dynamic feature toggling without deployments
- User/group targeting
- Gradual rollouts
- Integration with LaunchDarkly or custom solution

### 5. GraphQL Support (Optional)
- Add GraphQL endpoint alongside REST
- Use Strawberry or Graphene
- Schema-first development
- Subscription support for real-time features

### 6. Event Sourcing (For Complex Domains)
- Full audit trail of all changes
- Time-travel debugging
- CQRS pattern implementation
- Integration with message brokers

### 7. Multi-tenancy Support
- Database-per-tenant or schema-per-tenant
- Tenant isolation at API level
- Resource usage tracking per tenant
- Tenant-specific configurations

### 8. Advanced Caching Strategies
- Multi-level caching (Redis + in-memory)
- Cache warming strategies
- Predictive cache invalidation
- Edge caching with CDN integration

### 9. ML Model Serving Integration

### 10. Advanced Security Features
- Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules
- DDoS protection strategies
- Advanced rate limiting (per-user, per-endpoint)
- Security scanning in CI/CD pipeline

## ðŸ“Š Enhanced Monitoring Goals

### Performance Targets
- API response time < 50ms (p95) for cached requests
- < 100ms (p95) for database queries
- Zero-downtime deployments
- 99.99% uptime SLA

### Observability Stack
- Metrics: Prometheus + Grafana
- Logs: ELK Stack or Loki
- Traces: Jaeger or Zipkin
- Alerts: PagerDuty integration
